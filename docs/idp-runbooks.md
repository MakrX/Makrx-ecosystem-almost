## SMTP Config
1. In the identity provider admin console, open **Realm Settings** â†’ **Email**.
2. Set the SMTP **host** and **port** provided by infrastructure.
3. Set the **from** address that users will see when emails are sent.
4. Set the **reply-to** address for responses and support.
5. Save the settings and restart email-related services if required.

### Notes
- DKIM and SPF are managed by external DNS or email services and are not configured in the identity provider.
- After configuration changes, always test using throwaway accounts even in production to verify delivery and branding.
